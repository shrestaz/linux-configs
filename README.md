## This repository (currently) details how to implement custom CSS for Slack's dark mode and better font aliasing with emoji support in Linux. üêß

### This is a highly opinionated setup and an evergrowing repo. ‚ö†Ô∏è 


1. [Font config with emojis and better defaults](https://github.com/shrestaz/linux-configs/blob/master/font-config.md)

2. [Slack dark mode <img src="http://icons-for-free.com/free-icons/png/512/1626615.png" height="20">](https://github.com/shrestaz/linux-configs/blob/master/slack-dark-custom-css.md)

3. Arch Linux post-install script. (This is very opinionated and meant only for the owner.)
```
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shrestaz/linux-configs/master/fresh-install-script/fresh-install.sh | bash
```
